# External binary

This is a simple program
that outputs the product of two numbers,
used for the `py_ext_bin_test` example.

To build this on Linux/macOS systems run:
```bash
gcc c_test.c -o <platform>/c_test
```

On Windows,
run the following
and copy to the appropriate location:
```
cl c_test.c
```
